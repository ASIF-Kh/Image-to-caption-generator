# Image-to-Description Generator using TensorFlow



Creating an image-to-description generator with an RNN involves collecting a dataset of images paired with text descriptions. After preprocessing the data, extract image features using a CNN. Then, design the RNN model, typically utilizing LSTM or GRU cells. This model takes image features as input and generates descriptive text. Training involves optimizing the model's parameters to minimize the difference between generated and actual descriptions. Once trained, the system can take an image and produce human-like textual descriptions, bridging the gap between computer vision and natural language understanding.
